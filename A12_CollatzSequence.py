#Project 12 - COLLATZ SEQUENCE:

"""The Collatz sequence, also called the 3n + 1 problem,
is the simplest impossible math problem. (But donâ€™t worry,
the program itself is easy enough for beginners.) From a
starting number, n, follow three rules to get the next number in
the sequence:

If n is even, the next number n is n / 2.
If n is odd, the next number n is n * 3 + 1.
If n is 1, stop. Otherwise, repeat.
It is generally thought, but so far not 
mathematically proven, that every starting number
eventually terminates at 1. More information about the Collatz
sequence can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture."""

print(f"You have chosen 'n' to be the number {n}")
